            <img  class="dogs" src="dogs.png" alt="dogs" > 
            <p class="doggys" style="border: 3px solid maroon;">
                The audience is either people who are interested in purchasing a dog and are just looking at common trends in what breeds people were introduced during different time periods, or people who just like to learn the history of dogs.
         It tells us the popularity and awareness of different kind of dogs throughout the years (1870s-2010s) and it also shares different points in history where certain dogs came to use.
       
         Quantitative data of the years is on the y-axis and Nominal data is the types of breeds of dogs. The actual statistics is the popularity of the breed introduced in that year.
     
             It encodes its date using hue. You can tell that all the colors are very different for each breed. It also uses circles to represent the statistics. 

         Readers would compare values of all the breeds within that year and see how different breeds are more popular than others in the years.
  
         I’d say the principle truthful and functional go hand in hand as it can only function if it is correct data and I believe it is because it also incorporates different time periods that match the popularity of a certain breed. It’s beautiful because the colors aren't harsh on your eyes and contain good contrast. Its insightful and enlightening because the data is clear and concise so makes the reader more interested and isn't common knowledge. 
         
             This visualization is good because it not only incorporates all five principles but exceeds their expectations of a basic visualization. Its quite easy to understand, the message is clear and keeps the reader at a good level with not wondering more where and how the data was found.

            <img  class="energy" src="energy.png" alt="energy" >
            <p class="hockey" style="border: 3px solid maroon;">
                People who are eco-friendly or are just concerned about where energy comes from and which places are the our highest resource of energy.
               
                It answers how much energy is produced from places throughout the world. I believe it also aspires questions on how and what they can do to cut back on using these resources to help preserve them. It also implicates questions on what is using too much energy and how some of these places were destroyed and shut down.
               
                    The nominal data of the energy sources and some of the data is if they are not in use anymore whether its because they were destroyed or banned. The quantitative data of the amount of energy is produced from these places and also from large companies and how this energy could be used produce certain things to millions of people.
                
                This visualization used a bar graphs with a hue scale within the different types of energy sources but uses a value scale for the groups of energies and if they are discontinued they use a lighter value of color compared to the other ones. 
   
                The reader has to compare not only the different energy values of the sources but using the points in history it also shows to connect the energy values to that point.
  
                It goes beyond truthful by showing multiple different sources of facts and is functional where it is easy to understand what you are reading even with all the data presented. It is beautiful since the colors match well and using the value scale is a tool to make it easy on the eyes. Its insightful and enlightening because some of the data is quite shocking and makes you look into different energy sources more.
             
                This visualization is good, it contains all of the five principles and makes you want to dive deeper into more knowledge about the different sources of energy. It also makes you wonder if we as humans should be more aware of our sources and how much value they obtain.

                        The audience is any person who is interested or likes pop/hip hop songs, since those are most likely to be on the Billboard Top 5 Hit.

                    This visualization tells us the Billboard Top 5 hits of every year and month from the 1960s to April of 2019. It answers what artists were popular during that time and what songs were people listening too. 
                
                        Quantitative data of the years is on the y-axis, and the nominal data of each artist and song is on the x axis. The quantitative data is also portrayed along side that with the rankings of the song and artist. 
                    
                    It encodes the data using value, you can see that the lines leading up to the artists behind it is fading in value of that specific color. It is also using physical animation and pictures to bring the artists to the front of the graph and include the song of the year in the background.

                    Readers have to compare the artists and their rankings to one and another. They also can see a trend depending on the years if you play the graph from the 1960s to now what genres and artists were in those years and how they phased out. 

                    It’s truthful and functional as it shows accurate data that can be easily verified from every year and is functional that it will portray that data instantly. It’s beautiful because the colors aren't harsh on your eyes and contain good fade. Its insightful and enlightening because the data is clear so it makes the reader more interested on what the trends were or can spark up a new love for an artist. It also tells a story throughout the years of the growth of certain artists and just one-hit wonders. 
            
                    This visualization is good because it tells a story of how as the years pass, it swaps the artists out through animation. Also, the music in the background connects sight to sound making it more appealing. Its also very easy on the eyes with not bright pictures and nice contrast.

                Bad Designs

            <br>
            <img  class="fish" src="fish.png" alt="fish" > 
            <p class="hockey3" style="border: 3px solid maroon;">
                    
                    The audience can be anyone who maybe likes to fish or is from Kentucky.
                    
                    This visualization conveys a message that the amount of Kentucky marriages is in direct correlation with fishing deaths. 
  
                    The data has quantitative data with the amount of marriages in Kentucky and deaths off fishing boats and the years that these occurred. It also calcualated the correlation rate.
                    
                    This data is used as a line graph with hue for the separate lines representing the two values being compared.
     
                    The reader compares the two sets of data and sees a correlation even though its not likely true at all and just happens to look that way. 
                 
                    The principles that are contained is functionality since all of it is easy to understand. Truthfulness is not represented since the correlation percentage calculated since it is just false correlation. The graph isn't un-appealing to the reader but it could be better with the faint grey on white. It is neither insightful or enlightening since these two sets of data are very different and have no real connection.
                 
                    This visualization is bad since the data that is presented is presented in a way that it is untruthful and does not give the right message. It makes the reader confused with the two very different topics presented on the same thing.

                    The audience is either analytical people who are interested or studying the  employment rate, or just people wondering what type of companies people prefer. 
                    
                    This graph conveys the percentage of big and small companies with less than or greater than 50 people.
                   
                    The quantitative data of percentages of companies and number of people in each company is portrayed in the data.
                
                    This visualization uses a pie chart and the color scheme uses a blue value scale. It shows the percentages in the pie chart.

                    The readers need to compare the percentages of companies, but needs to do it with the numbers not the visual, since it portrays that 42 percent is bigger than 56 percent. 

                    This pie chart contains none of these principles, it is inaccurate when comparing percentages, nor functional, since it only adds up to 98 percent. It is not beautiful since the colors are very close together nor can you discover much after it.
                  
                    This visualization is bad, of anything it tricks the reader into thinking small companies have a bigger percentage of less than 50 people than big companies. It also does not contain any of the five principles and makes no sense.

                    The target audience is active tennis fans.
               
                This visualization contains the age ranges of different tennis players when they were #1 in the world from the 1973-2018.
   
                The Nominal data of the names of the players is used to portray the quantitative data of the ages they were when they were #1 in the world.
     
                This visualization uses the value scale as its background of different shades of pastel colors, and then uses different rectangles to represent the ages of each player.

                The user has to compare ages of different tennis players and what the max age was to be the #1 tennis player in the world.

                The principle of truthful is the only principle used in this visualization. It is not that functional since it is hard to understand read, nor it is beautiful since the colors of the actual data are very displeasing, We cant gather much data and the reader would not find it insightful or enlightening. 
               
                This visualization is bad, it does not portray the data well and makes it hard for the user to understand whats happening. It could use a separate access for the year they were #1 and better color coordination.

                            I used a different design so the reader could more easily understand it and compare the data. Instead of the original design, I converted the data into a bar chart showing the percentages of players in that age when they were the #1 tennis players in the world. I used quantitative data, percentages and ages to represent the data. 
                            
                            It provides more insight on what age ranges were higher in percentage than others for and makes it easier to compare and analyze the data than the original. 
                           
                            The redesign makes it easier than the original since its hard to follow along and know what years and groups are being used. Instead a scattered chart of players and random rectangles trying to represent their ages, it condenses the information.
  
                            I had to compromise the bit to bit data and stack them into percentages since it was too hard to fit all the data and still make it clean and understandable.

                                I decided to split the graphs into two different graphs containing the same data. I used a line graph and hue for the colors, and quantitative data to represent the deaths after falling off a fishing boat and years of one graph and the marriages in Kentucky to the years in the other. 
                            
                                My redesign is better than the other because it does not provide an inaccurate sense that the two sets of data have a direct correlation even though it looks like it.
                               
                                I think that the important principle of it being truthful and functional is represented in my redesign where as in the original it is more of a coincidence that those two graphs are similar than directly related. It is more insightful in their own personal subjects not in a way where you can look them up together.
                  
                                I had to make two graphs instead of one to not have the reader confused that these graphs are correlated.
