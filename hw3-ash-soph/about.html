		<h1>Our Story</h1>
		For this homework we decided to reuse the dataset we used for homework 2. We 
		both found this dataset very interesting and gained a lot of insight from the 
		exploratory analysis we performed in Tableau. The Olympics are divided by 
		countries and we wanted to learn more about how many medals each country produces each year.
		We decided to visually encode our data into stacked charts because we thought 
		this effectively displayed the difference between the total number of medals earned each year 
		and how many were earned by each country. Different colors were used to encode the nominal 
		data of the countries because they are each distinct, different, and canâ€™t be ordered. Then once
		the user clicks on a particular country, more information regarding how many medals they have earned is
		shown through an area chart.
		<br>
		We faced a few difficulties during this assignment. First we realized that we need to 
		change how our Excel dataset was organized. We performed some exploratory analysis on 
		this dataset in Excel to determine the best way to reorganize the dataset. Below we added pictures of the dataset we
		started with and the one we obtained after manipulating the data. The biggest challenege we faced was 
		figuring out different interactive ways to display clear data. We found ourselves not being able to find sources to aid
		us in this assignments.
